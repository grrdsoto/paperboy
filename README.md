## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to produce a device that will allow a professor in the field of Political Science to have the device display current events related to the current class topic, or any current events. The goal is for our device to have the aesthetic of a device from yesteryear, while being modern in that it displays the news dynamically. 

## Initial Design Plan


## Hardware Design

The hardware we will use for this project will be a Rasperry Pi and a display screen. The pi and the display will be housed in a wooden box, and resemble something like a miniature newspaper box. The idea is that people will want to take a look at whatever is being displayed, with the hopes that the device provides them with news for them to be up to date with the latest hubbub.

## Software Design

We will be using Python 3 for our coding. This will enable us to easily search the web, as well as programming the needed functionality of the device. We will also be using Flask to design a website that will act as a search engine for recent news.

## Data Design

It will be saving user-specific inputs. Ex: What do you want to search for? What sources do you want to use? What type of news? 

## Additional Requirement

We have made both a physical case (newspaper box w/ Pi and display) and a website for this system.

## Delegation of Tasks


Logan Owens- Meet with Professor Berheide, meet with Richmond Register, help design website, work on news crawling code,
test website, scribe,

Nick Straub-Deck- Meet with Richmond Register, work on news crawling code, sourced materials, helped repurpose box, test website, scribe,

Dustin Young- Help design website, work on news crawling code, made designs, test website, design login for website, scribe, 

Gerardo Soto- Meet with Richmond Register, work on news crawling code, keep Richmond Register up-to-date, design login for website, test website, scribe,


## Files

news.py- searches predetermined sources for a user chosen topic. Ex: search The New York Times for Mexico.

paperboy.py- manages hosting of website and it's resources, like design templates.

html files that host the design layouts and templates of the site.

core bootstrap contains CSS and JS files for the site templates and aesthetics.

## Instructions

1. You will access the website via the address, which we will give to Berheide.

2. You will asign him a username and password that he will use to access the site.

3. Once you have entered the site, you will be able to access a page to change what you'll be looking for, where to look for it, 
and this update on it's own once a day.

4. Once that is changed, the display page will cycle through various news articles about your chosen topic through chosen sources.
